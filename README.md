# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This Program covers the sentiment analysis of any topic by parsing the tweets fetched from Twitter using Python.

Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.

Tweepy: tweepy is the python client for the official Twitter API.
Install it using following pip command:
pip install tweepy

TextBlob: textblob is the python library for processing textual data.
Install it using following pip command:
pip install textblob
python -m textblob.download_corpora
(Corpora is nothing but a large and structured set of texts.)

Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and click the button: ‘Create New App’
Fill the application details. You can leave the callback url field empty.
Once the app is created, you will be redirected to the app page.
Open the ‘Keys and Access Tokens’ tab.
Copy ‘Consumer Key’, ‘Consumer Secret’, ‘Access token’ and ‘Access Token Secret’.

This programs is yet to be updated , since there are some inaccuracies in the input tweets take from the twitter api, but the rest of the code is working properly .
